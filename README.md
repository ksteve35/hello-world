Assignment for COSC 381.

Hello!

My name is Kyle Stevenson and I am at EMU enrolled in COSC 381 - Software Engineering Solutions!
I am taking this course because I was referred by Bill Sverdlik, who said it was a great class
to learn how to use Git and GitHub, as well as learning how to program in a team, as that is a
valuable (and required) skill out in the real world.
